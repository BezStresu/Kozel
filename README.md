The project presents a remote-controlled robot capable of moving based on commands transmitted via Bluetooth and featuring a line-tracking function. The robot is equipped with sensors that measure acceleration, light intensity, and distance from obstacles. Its main functionalities include remote control, line tracking, distance measurement, acceleration measurement, and Bluetooth communication. Remote control allows the robot to receive commands through the Bluetooth module and respond to speed, direction, and line-tracking mode activation instructions. The autonomous mode utilizes the analysis of reflected light intensity to adjust its path, while built-in ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles and prevent collisions. The ADXL345 accelerometer monitors the robot's movement, and Bluetooth communication enables data transmission to a master device.

The source code structure includes several key files. The Robot.h and Robot.cpp files define the main robot class and methods for controlling movement and collecting sensor data. The set_piloting_data() function allows the transmission of control data to the robot, set_movement() controls speed and direction, track_mode() manages the line-tracking mode, and get_acceleration_x/y/z() and get_distance() return sensor readings. The SensorsTest.h and SensorsTest.cpp files handle testing of distance, light intensity, and acceleration sensors. The distance_test() function reads data from the ultrasonic sensor and displays results on the console. The Transport.h and Transport.cpp files implement functions for sending and receiving data packets via Bluetooth. The send_packet() function transmits acceleration, light intensity, and distance data, while read_packet() receives control data such as steering angle, speed, and operating mode. The main.cpp file contains the main program loop managing the robot's operation. The collect_data() function receives control data via Bluetooth and passes it to the robot, watch_and_send_data() reads sensor data and transmits it to the control device, setup() initializes the modules, and loop() continuously performs data collection and transmission.

The project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller, PWM-controlled motors, an ADXL345 accelerometer, a light sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, and an HC-06 Bluetooth module. The robot combines remote control with autonomous movement along a designated path. By using various sensors, it can adapt its behavior to the environment, avoid obstacles, and transmit telemetry data. The implementation allows for further expansion with more advanced line-tracking algorithms and an obstacle avoidance system.
